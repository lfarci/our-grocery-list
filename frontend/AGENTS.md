# Frontend Agent Instructions

- Review `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to align UI changes with the documented product behavior for the single shared grocery list.
- Use the React and TypeScript Copilot guidance in `.github/instructions/react.instructions.md` and `.github/instructions/typescript.instructions.md` (both present in this repo) for code style and patterns in this directory.
- Keep interfaces touch-friendly and minimal: one list view with add form, item actions, and straightforward flows.
- Avoid introducing extra features (accounts, rooms, multiple lists) and keep copy concise and accessible.
- Follow more specific instructions from any nested `AGENTS.md` files inside the frontend directory.
